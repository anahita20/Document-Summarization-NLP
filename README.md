# Document Summarization using weighted feature approach in NLP and Keras Neural Networks.
The final outcome is to create a Neural Network model with appropriate loss and metric functions using TensorFlow that will produce the optimal weights for aggregating various NLP feature scores, which will produce the most representative summary sentence of an article.
<br /> Also, used pretrained models TextRank and TFHub to compare and illustrate the results.
<br />Dataset used here is BBC News Summary.
